    <h2>Knotless Braids</h2>
    <p class="services-text">
      Knotless braids are three-strand braid with a beneficial twist. Like box
      braids, your hair is divided into square parts or sometimes
      triangle-shaped divisions However, knotless braids do not include the
      small knot that starts at the root of traditional box braids.
      Traditionally, this knot is used to attach braiding hair. With knotless
      braids, the hairstyle is created with a feed-in braids technique instead.
      This involves adding small amounts of braiding hair to your natural hair
      as you go, making for a braid that sports a flatter appearance. As a
      result, your braids also aren’t as heavy on your scalp, which can help
      minimize the risk of hair breakage. knotless braids can come in the same
      sizes and lengths as traditional box braids.

    <h2 class="services-header">Traditional Box Braids</h2>
    <p class="services-text">
      Box braids are individual plaits that are usually divided by small squared
      off parts or boxes. Box braids may be of any width or length, but most
      women add synthetic or natural hair to the braid for length as well as
      thickness and fullness. The great thing about these braids is that because
      they are not attached to the scalp like cornrows are, they may be
      manipulated into several different styles. It may take a long time to
      complete the style, but the finished product is beautiful and lasts for
      months. With box braids you can see the knot where the extension has been
      added”. Traditional box braids tend to stay fresh looking just a little
      longer than Knotless box braids.

    <h2 class="services-header">Micro Braids</h2>
    <p class="services-text">
      Micro braids are the kind of braiding style that is more delicate and
      small. The braids are woven tightly to the scalp, and the great thing
      about the style is that they can stay in your hair for months. It’s a
      popular style amongst African Americans, though it can be a style that
      everyone can use as well. The style is mainly done using human hair but
      can also be done using any light human like braiding hair. The protective
      hairstyle is known for its versatility because it can be easily
      manipulated into numerous styles including buns, ponytails, curls, and
      various up-dos. As you can imagine, these braids typically take a long
      time to install, as only a few strands of hair are used for each braid —
      making them much lighter in weight than other protective styles.

    <h2 class="services-header">Faux Locs</h2>
    <p class="services-text">
      Faux locs are basically commitment-free dreads. A fun alternative to
      braids or wearing your natural hair out, they're perfect for anyone who
      wants a low maintenance way of switching up their look without damaging
      their hair. Goddess locs and faux locs look almost the same, but the
      difference is that goddess locs usually have curls in the loc and on the
      tips. Faux locs typically look like real locs with no added hair to the
      ends.

    <h2 class="services-header">Goddess Faux Locs</h2>
    <p class="services-text">
      Goddess locs resembles real locs but with curls added to the look. It is
      usually made with kinky Marley hair and curly synthetic extensions or
      kinky human hair and curly human hair extensions. Instead of every hair
      perfectly laying in place, this style emphasizes the lived-in, undone
      effect with curls popping out, accentuating the locs. Goddess locs and
      faux locs look almost the same, but the difference is that goddess locs
      usually have curls in the loc and on the tips,” says Koudou. “Faux locs
      typically look like real locs with no added hair to the tips. Think of
      goddess locs as a bohemian look, perfect for vacation on a beach.”

    <h2 class="services-header">Butterfly Locs</h2>
    <p class="services-text">
      Butterfly locs are a variant of faux locs where wavy hair is looped into a
      braid using a crotchet needle and then loosely wrapped to give it a
      distressed/unraveled look. Butterfly Locs are like the perfect mix of
      goddess locs and passion twists. The messy, bohemian style is ethereal,
      low maintenance, and very natural looking. When properly maintained, you
      can wear this style for four to six weeks.

      Senegalese Twists, or “rope twists” are one of the many protective styles
      for Afro-textured hair. ... Senegalese twists are created by first
      wrapping your choice of braiding hair around the root of your natural
      hair. The hair is then two-strand twisted using kanekalon braiding hair

    <p class="services-text">
      Havana or Marley twists are natural fiber twist extensions worn as a
      protective natural hair style. Just Like Marley Twists, Havana twists tend
      to be a bit larger in size than other protective styles. They are named
      Marley Twists because the thick coarse hair required for the style results
      in a look that resembles dreadlocks, like those notoriously worn by the
      late Jamaican singer Bob Marley. The kanekalon hair that is used for the
      style is the most similar to an afro texture.

      A kinky twist is a medium-length protective hairstyle made with 2-strand
      twists with springy ends. Kinky twists are a two-strand twist that
      generally falls at the shoulders with curled ends. Other than the length
      of the twists, there are one other major differences between Kinky twists
      and Marley twists. The difference is the size. Even though kinky twists

      water wave hair extension. This is also called the boho look. Passion
      twists were created by a stylist who wanted a hairstyle similar to goddess
      locs in less time. This hairstyle has gained massive popularity and is
      trending. This hairstyle is a go-to if you are bored with the same old
      locs and twists. The secret to this hairstyle is wavy hair extensions as
      they give a curly texture when forming passion twists.
